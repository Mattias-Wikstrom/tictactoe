## Tic-Tac-Toe 

The console version can be started by running 'npm run console' in the main folder.

Unit tests for the code in 'shared' can be run by running 'npm run test' inside the 'shared' folder.

## Setup
Run 'npm install' before anything else.

Commands that may be needed (to be fixed later):
* npm install --save-dev antlr4ng
* npm install --save-dev jest
